 []\OT1/cmtt/m/n/12 RIGHT - This is a tricky question about order of operations
 and integer overflow. The expression `2_147_483_647 + 1` is evaluated *before*
 the assignment to `result`. Both operands are `int` literals, so the addition 
is performed using 32-bit integer arithmetic. `2_147_483_647` is `Integer.MAX_V
ALUE`. Adding 1 to it causes an overflow, which wraps around to `Integer.MIN_VA
LUE`, which is `-2147483648`. Only after this calculation is the resulting `int
` value (`-2147483648`) widened and assigned to the `long` variable `result`.
