I've deleted a group-closing symbol because it seems to be
spurious, as in `$x}$'. But perhaps the } is legitimate and
you forgot something else, as in `\hbox{$x}'. In such cases
the way to recover is to insert both the forgotten and the
deleted material, e.g., by typing `I$}'.

I can't figure out why you would want to use a tab mark
here. If you just want an ampersand, the remedy is
simple: Just type `I\&' now. But if some right brace
up above has ended a previous alignment prematurely,
you're probably due for more error messages, and you
might try typing `S' now just to see what is salvageable.

Overfull \hbox (1924.05763pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 1837--1837
 []\OT1/cmtt/m/n/12 RIGHT - The `++` operator is a compound assignment operator
, equivalent here to `s = (short)(s + 1)`. The value of `s` is `32767` (`Short.
MAX_VALUE`). The expression `s + 1` is promoted to `int`, resulting in `32768`.
 The implicit cast `(short)` then attempts to fit this value into a short, caus
ing an overflow. The value wraps around to `Short.MIN_VALUE`, which is `-32768`
.
