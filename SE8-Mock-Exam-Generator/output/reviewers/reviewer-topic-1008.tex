\section*{Topic 1008: Java Operators and Precedence}

\subsection*{Thinking Like the Compiler: The Rules of Evaluation}
Operators are the verbs of Java; they perform actions. Simple expressions like \texttt{2 + 3} are easy, but the exam will present complex expressions and ask for the exact result. To answer correctly, you can't just guess the order of operationsâ€”you must know it. This topic is all about operator precedence (which operator goes first) and associativity (what to do in a tie). Getting this right is pure precision.

\subsection*{The Most Important Operators for the Exam}

\subsubsection*{Unary Operators: \texttt{++} and \texttt{--}}
This is a guaranteed exam topic. You must master the difference between pre- and post-increment/decrement.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Post-Increment (\texttt{x++}):} The expression evaluates to the \textit{original} value of \texttt{x}, and \textit{then} \texttt{x} is incremented.
    \item \textbf{Pre-Increment (\texttt{++x}):} \texttt{x} is incremented \textit{first}, and the expression evaluates to the \textit{new} value of \texttt{x}.
\end{itemize}
\begin{verbatim}
int a = 5;
int b = a++; // Step 1: b is assigned the original value of a (5).
             // Step 2: a is incremented to 6.
             // Result: a is 6, b is 5.

int c = 5;
int d = ++c; // Step 1: c is incremented to 6.
             // Step 2: d is assigned the new value of c (6).
             // Result: c is 6, d is 6.
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection*{Logical Operators and Short-Circuiting: \texttt{\&\&} and \texttt{||}}
This is another critical concept. The short-circuiting operators can prevent the right-hand side of an expression from being executed.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\texttt{\&\&} (AND):} If the left side is \texttt{false}, the result is automatically \texttt{false}, and the right side is \textbf{never evaluated}.
    \item \textbf{\texttt{||} (OR):} If the left side is \texttt{true}, the result is automatically \texttt{true}, and the right side is \textbf{never evaluated}.
\end{itemize}
This is crucial when the right-hand side has a side effect, like an increment operator.
\begin{verbatim}
int x = 10;
// The left side (x > 10) is false. The right side (x++ > 10)
// is never executed. x is not incremented.
if (x > 10 && x++ > 10) {
    // not reached
}
System.out.println(x); // Prints 10

// The non-short-circuiting version (&) evaluates both sides always.
int y = 10;
if (y > 10 & y++ > 10) {
    // not reached
}
System.out.println(y); // Prints 11 (y++ was executed)
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection*{Other Key Operators}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Integer Division:} An \texttt{int} divided by an \texttt{int} always results in a truncated \texttt{int}. \texttt{7 / 2} is \texttt{3}.
    \item \textbf{Assignment \texttt{=}:} Has very low precedence and is right-associative. \texttt{x = y = 5;} is valid; it assigns \texttt{5} to \texttt{y}, and then assigns the result of that (which is 5) to \texttt{x}.
    \item \textbf{Equality \texttt{==}:} For objects, this compares memory addresses, not content. Use \texttt{.equals()} for meaningful comparison of object values.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Operator Precedence: A Simplified Guide}
You don't need to memorize the entire official chart. Focus on these groups, from highest to lowest precedence.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Precedence} & \textbf{Operators} & \textbf{Associativity} \\
\hline
1 (Highest) & Post-unary: \texttt{expr++}, \texttt{expr--} & Left-to-right \\
2 & Pre-unary: \texttt{++expr}, \texttt{--expr}, \texttt{+}, \texttt{-}, \texttt{!} & Right-to-left \\
3 & Multiplicative: \texttt{*}, \texttt{/}, \texttt{\%} & Left-to-right \\
4 & Additive: \texttt{+}, \texttt{-} & Left-to-right \\
5 & Relational: \texttt{>}, \texttt{<}, \texttt{>=}, \texttt{<=}, \texttt{instanceof} & Left-to-right \\
6 & Equality: \texttt{==}, \texttt{!=} & Left-to-right \\
7 & Logical AND: \texttt{\&\&} & Left-to-right \\
8 & Logical OR: \texttt{||} & Left-to-right \\
9 & Ternary: \texttt{? :} & Right-to-left \\
10 (Lowest) & Assignment: \texttt{=}, \texttt{+=}, \texttt{-=}, etc. & Right-to-left \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\textbf{Golden Rule:} When you see a complex expression, don't guess. Either apply the precedence rules strictly or, even better, observe how parentheses \texttt{()} are used. Parentheses override all precedence rules. For example, in \texttt{3 + 4 * 5}, multiplication happens first (result 23). In \texttt{(3 + 4) * 5}, addition happens first (result 35).

\section*{Key Takeaways for the 1Z0-808 Exam}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Master Increment/Decrement:} Know the difference between \texttt{x++} and \texttt{++x} cold. Trace variables step-by-step.
    \item \textbf{Watch for Short-Circuits:} In \texttt{\&\&} and \texttt{||} expressions, check if the right-hand side has a side effect that might not happen.
    \item \textbf{Know the Precedence Tiers:} At a minimum, know that unary operators are high, then arithmetic, then relational, then logical, and finally assignment is last.
    \item \textbf{Trust Parentheses:} Parentheses dictate the order of evaluation, period.
\end{itemize}
